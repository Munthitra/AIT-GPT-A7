This web application demonstrates a chatbot developed for the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) using the Dash framework. The chatbot provides information about AIT's history, policies, facilities, services, and related topics. Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions and receive coherent responses along with relevant source documents.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the AIT Student Handbook for the August 2023 Semester. The dataset contains information about AIT's regulations, services, and other relevant policies. The dataset can be accessed on the AIT website at the following link:

I would like to give a credit to the Fast Chat model (https://huggingface.co/lmsys/fastchat-t5-3b-v1.0) which powered by FastChat-T5, an open-source chatbot developed by Dacheng Li, Lianmin Zheng, and Hao Zhang. FastChat-T5 is based on the Flan-t5-xl model (3B parameters), fine-tuned on 70K user-shared conversations from ShareGPT. It uses an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to generate responses to user inputs.

The chatbot's ability to provide clear and helpful responses has been good. It understands user questions well and gives useful answers

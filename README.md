This web application demonstrates a chatbot developed for the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) using the Dash framework. The chatbot provides information about AIT's history, policies, facilities, services, and related topics. Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions and receive coherent responses along with relevant source documents.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the AIT Student Handbook for the August 2023 Semester. The dataset contains information about AIT's regulations, services, and other relevant policies. The dataset can be accessed on the AIT website at the following link:
